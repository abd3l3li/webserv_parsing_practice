Q&A:

 - how we re using get function without creating an instance of its obj
 - explain me this syntax get().x
 - how it this struct linked to tokens struct

 - how nginx handling the order of the keyword --> does must be sorted or any order can be accepted and we must handle it
 - what is diff between peek and get

 - explain me more about of the location /upload for ex, why need this then again in the block we get anoter one

 - how the three classes connected to each other and how is the relation worked

ðŸ“˜ Functions in Parser.cpp :

ðŸ§  Summary Table :

 | Function / Loop           | What it does                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parser::Parser(...)       | Saves the list of tokens and resets the cursor (\_index)     |
| peek()                    | Look at the current token (no advance)                       |
| get()                     | Get the current token and move to the next                   |
| while (not END\_OF\_FILE) | Loop through all server blocks                               |
| while (inside server)     | Parse server directives and location blocks                  |
| while (inside location)   | Parse location settings like root, index, autoindex, methods |

notes:

the third while for what ??
handle duplication --> maybe using a vector
split the parser code

-------------------- my understanding of parser funcs --------------------------

- the first loop works for checking for more than one server creatin new conf each time .
- the second loop works for checking single element each time in a server and creating new ServerConfig each time .
- the third loop works for doing the same as the server one but for the location block .
- the fourth one works for the methods that will be stored in one of ServerConfig vector .
